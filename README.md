Monitoring Workspace Productivity: An Arduino-Based Environmental Data Logging System

Productivity in a workspace is influenced by multiple environmental factors, such as lighting conditions, noise levels, and movement patterns. However, many workspaces lack automated monitoring systems that provide insights into how these factors affect efficiency. Without concrete data, users may struggle to identify and optimize their environment for maximum productivity. This project aims to develop a desk productivity monitoring system using an Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi and various sensors to collect real-time data on key environmental factors.
